# Important Set Up Instructions:
  Make sure you name your virtual environment virt_env so that the .gitignore doesn't 
  add it to the repository.
  
 # Virtual Environment pip installs:
    numpy
    django
    spotipy
    django-crispy-forms
    Pillow
    django-phonenumber-field[phonenumbers]
  
  The .gitignore does not include the database. You may need to repeat Baliga's
  instructions on how to get the Kaggle music data into your local database.
  All of the files for Window's are included in the git repository.

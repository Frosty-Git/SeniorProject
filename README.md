## Important Set Up Instructions:
  If you're creating your virtual environment inside the project, make sure you name your virtual environment **virt_env** so that the .gitignore doesn't add it to the repository.
  
## Virtual Environment pip installs:
    numpy
    django
    spotipy
    Pillow
    django-widget-tweaks
  
The .gitignore does not include the database. You may need to repeat Baliga's
instructions on how to get the Kaggle music data into your local database.
All of the files for Windows are included in the git repository.
